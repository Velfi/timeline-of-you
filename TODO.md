# TODOs

- **UX Improvement** Display the events list in `/timeline/quick-add-events` as a nested list. This means not
  years/months/days when multiple events occur in the same year/month/day.
- Add testing timeline that loads when in debug mode so I don't have to keep reloading the timeline from the management page.
