    WARNING: This app is under heavy development right now. Don't use it unless you're OK with
    things breaking and data being lost. I'll remove this banner when it's ready for prime time. If
    you do try out the app anyways and encounter any bugs, please let me know by <a
      href="https://github.com/Velfi/timeline-of-you/issues/new">filing an issue on GitHub</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a personal project that I'm working on to make it easier for me (and others like me) to
    keep track of when significant events in our lives happen. This app is free and open-source. No
    data is stored on my server. It's all stored in your browser or in JSON files.

    If you're interested in having a look around, click the Robot in the upper-left corner to open
    the menu.
